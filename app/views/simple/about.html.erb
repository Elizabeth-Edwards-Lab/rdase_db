      TEST Reductive Dehalogenase Database is a freely available electronic database containing the largest and most comprehensive set of amino acid sequence and nucleotide sequence of reductive dehalogenase enzymes. Organohalide respiring bacteria (OHRB) are the organisms that produce reductive dehalogenase enzymes (RDases or RdhA if uncharacterized) for catalyzing dechlorination. The database currently houses 610 sequences of reductive dehalogenase enzymes. The enzyme responsible for cleaving the halide bond is the reductive dehalogenase A subunit. The use of organohalide respiring bacteria for dechlorination in contaminated soil and groundwater has had considerable interest and success in recent years. Each organohalide respiring bacteria harbours multiple reductive dehalogenase genes. However, only a very select few proteins have been biochemically characterized to any extent. In 2013, Hug et al. developed an ortholog-based classification system for reductive dehalogenases by defining orthologous groups, in order to integrate new sequencing data and unify the terminology used, especially for reductive dehalogenases whose functions are unknown. All the enzymes are classified into 84 groups based on the similarity of their sequences (>90% identity). The database includes most studied organohalide respiring bacteria such as: Dehalococcoides mccartyi, Dehalobacter WL, Desulfitobacterium sp., Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans, etc. Reductive Dehalogenase Database also includes information about interactive substrates and inhibitors for each related enzymes. All Reductive Dehalogenase Database data is downloadable and is intended for applications in genomics, ligand-enzyme interaction discovery, and general education. The purpose of this database is to provide public access to a database of all reductive dehalogenase sequences and classify them into orthologous groups with the underlying assumption that sequences found in the same group share the same function.

        Reductive dehalogenase enzymes occur in an operon containing rdhA, rdhB, rdhC, and sometimes additional genes. Protein is identified based on the presence of three motifs: a twin-arginine TAT membrane export sequence (RRXFXK), an eight-iron ferredoxin cluster binding motif (CXXCXXCXXXCP) and various modifications of a cobalamin binding motif (DXHXXGSXLGG).

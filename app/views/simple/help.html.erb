		<strong>How does Reductive Dehalogenase Database (RDaseDB) assign sequences to groups?</strong>
		
		<p>
			A reductive dehalogenase amino acid sequence is considered to be part of an ortholog group (OG) if it shares more than 90% pairwise identity with all current members of an OG. New sequences which cannot be sorted into a group are added as singletons. A more detailed breakdown is described below:
		</p>
		<p>
			We first ascertain the full-length pairwise amino acid identity of your novel sequence(s) with the best-match protein from the reductive dehalogenase database. This is done using BLASTP searches of your sequence queried against the current reductive dehalogenase amino acid sequence database.
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) If your sequence has less than 90% identity at the amino acid level to any sequence in the current database, it is given a singleton identifier number.
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) If your sequence has greater than or equal to 90% pairwise identity at the amino acid level to a sequence in current database, we identify the group that your sequence belongs to.
		</p>
			

		<div id="abouttext-help">
			<b>This is done in the follows: </b><br>
			<b>i.</b> If the sequence shows higher or equal to 90% identity to all members of an ortholog group, the sequence is added to that group.<br>
			<b>ii.</b>  If your sequence does not shows higher or equal to 90% identity to all members of an ortholog groups, your sequence cannot be added to the group, but can be described as a close relative to that cluster. The sequence will be given a singleton identifier number and curated by the Edwards lab.<br>
			<b>iii.</b>  If your sequence shows higher or equal to 90% identity to a sington sequence, a new ortholog group may be constructed once the sequence has curated by the Edwards lab.<br>

			<strong>How phylogenetic tree (including user sequence) is constructed? </strong>
				
				<p>
					You can construct a phylogenetic tree including your sequence from the blast result
					page. This tree (Neighbor Joining) is calculated from an alignment constructed from
					your sequence and the full database or a selection of sequences. Both the alignment
					and the tree is constructed by <a href="https://www.drive5.com/muscle/manual/treeout.html" target="_blank">MUSCLE</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Notably, the alignment is not edited, and the resulting tree should only be use as a first approximation of the phylogenetic position of your sequence.
				</p>
				<p>
					To construct phylogenetic trees for publications we recommend you download the
					sequences you want to include in the tree, align them in MUSCLE or <a href="https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/" target="_blank">MAFFT</a>,
					inspect and edit the alignment manually, and then construct the phylogenetic tree using
					your favourite software (e.g. IQTree, FastTree, RAxML).

		<h3>Submission rules</h3>
		<hr>
		<strong>How to submit a sequence to the Reductive Dehalogenase Database (RDaseDB)?</strong><br>
		<p>
			For automatic submissions, we only accept publicly available sequences that have an accession number from Genbank or IMG, and that have been annotated as a reductive dehalogenase. You can submit upto 20 sequences per file.
		</p>

		<p>The sequences must be in fasta format with the following header:</p>
		<p id="fasta-format-p">
			> Self-assigned ID or Name | Accession No. | Organism | Citation (optional) |<br>
			Your Amino Acid Sequence/Nucleotide Sequence ...<br>
			> 8657042VS | WP_012881438 | Dehalococcoides mccartyi VS | | <br>
			MEMNIYHSTISRRNFMKGLGLSGAALGAATASA...<br>
			> ...<br>
			 ...<br>
		</p>



		<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
		  Only sequences with the correct format will be accepted. If you want to discuss submitting sequences without a valid accession number or that have not been annotated as a reductive dehalogenase, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.

      | The Reductive Dehalogenase Database is a freely available electronic database containing the
      |  largest and most comprehensive set of amino acid sequence and nucleotide sequence of reductive
      |  dehalogenase enzymes. Â In 2013, 
      a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3638463/' target="_blank" Hug et al.
      |  developed an ortholog-based
      |  classification system for reductive dehalogenases by defining orthologous groups (OG), in order
      |  to integrate new sequencing data and unify the terminology used, especially for reductive
      |  dehalogenases whose functions are unknown. The Reductive Dehalogenase Database is a tool to help the 
      |  analysis and facilitate OG- classification of new reductive dehalogenases.
